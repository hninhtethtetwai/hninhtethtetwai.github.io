Hi, I'm Hnin Htet Htet Wai, Data Analyst with a solid foundation in data management, analysis, and visualization, developed through my studies at Humber College. With 10 years of experience as a BIM(building information modelling) Coordinator in Singapore, I bring strong organizational, problem-solving, and process optimization skills. Currently seeking a co-op opportunity to apply my technical skills in data analysis and contribute to business decision-making.
